💡 Why Is Technology the Top-Selling Category?
One of the key business questions this dashboard answers is:
Why does the Technology category consistently lead in total sales?

🔍 After analyzing various metrics, the insight is both surprising and strategic:
It's not because Technology had the most:

Orders 🧾

Customers 👥

Products 📦

Or even the highest Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) 💳

🚫 None of these were the driving factors.

✅ The Real Reason? Order Value.
📈 Technology products had a significantly higher average order value:

3x more than Office Supplies

1.3x more than Furniture

And here’s the kicker:
When we look at the Top 10 highest-selling sub-categories,
🔥 Every single Technology sub-category is on that list.

This proves that a smaller number of high-value transactions is what pushes Technology to the top —
not volume, but value per transaction.
